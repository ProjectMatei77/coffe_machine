Coffee Machine Simulator

This is a Python program simulating a coffee machine that can prepare three types of coffee drinks: **Latte**, **Cappuccino**, and **Espresso**. The machine accepts coins, and users can choose their desired drink. The program also provides two additional features: turning the machine off and generating a report to see the remaining ingredients.

## Features

- **Latte**: A coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk.
- **Cappuccino**: A coffee drink made with espresso, steamed milk, and foam.
- **Espresso**: A simple coffee drink made with espresso only.
- **Coin Insertion**: The machine accepts coins and allows users to pay for their drinks.
- **Off Option**: Users can choose to turn off the machine.
- **Report**: Users can generate a report to check how much of each ingredient (coffee, milk, water) is left in the machine.
